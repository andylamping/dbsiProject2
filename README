This Program has the ability to insert/append records to a heap file (saved to disk), as well as build/rebuild hash indexes on each column of the heap file. If an index exists and records are appended to the heap, the column with the index automatically hashes the records.

================




To compile the program on Linux machine

cd /src/
javac */*.java

To run the code - please enclose all special operators within " " quotes.

eg.
java Tester/Test heapFile.hf -i "<" example.acsv

java Tester/Test heapFile.hf -b1 -b2

java Tester/Test heapFile.hf -s1 "=" 1

java Tester/Test heapFile.hf -s3 ">" 4


To display the output onto a file 
/*
  This will paste the output to the file example_output.acsv
*/

java Tester/Test heapFile.hf > example_output.acsv 


The number of records in each Bucket is kept at 4.
